# Phase 5: Fraud Detection ML Model

## Model Integration
- [ ] Add fraud detection CoreML model to project
- [ ] Create FraudDetectionService.swift
- [ ] Initialize Vision request with model
- [ ] Set up preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Configure confidence thresholds

## Feature Extraction
- [ ] Extract holographic pattern features
- [ ] Analyze card border consistency
- [ ] Check font characteristics
- [ ] Measure color saturation levels
- [ ] Detect printing artifacts

## Model Inference
- [ ] Run model on high-res card image
- [ ] Process results on background queue
- [ ] Calculate authenticity score (0-100)
- [ ] Identify suspicious regions
- [ ] Generate confidence level

## Results Visualization
- [ ] Create FraudResultView.swift
- [ ] Show authenticity score gauge
- [ ] Highlight suspicious areas overlay
- [ ] Color-code confidence levels
- [ ] Add detailed explanation text

## User Education
- [ ] Create "Learn More" section
- [ ] Show authentic vs fake examples
- [ ] List common fake indicators
- [ ] Add tips for physical inspection
- [ ] Include reporting mechanism
